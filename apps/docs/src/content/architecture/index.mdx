# Architecture Overview

The EVEN Artist Dashboard is a modern web application built with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and shared packages.

## System Context

The following diagram shows how the EVEN platform fits into its broader context, including external systems and user types.

## Key Components

The platform consists of several key components:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| [Web App](/architecture/components/web-app) | Next.js 15, React 19 | Artist dashboard UI |
| [API Server](/architecture/components/api) | Fastify 5.2 | REST API endpoints |
| [Shared Packages](/architecture/components/shared-packages) | TypeScript | Reusable types and utilities |

## Architecture Principles

The architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Monorepo Structure** - All code lives in a single repository with clear package boundaries
2. **Type Safety** - TypeScript strict mode with Zod schema validation
3. **Component-Based UI** - Reusable UI components via shadcn/ui patterns
4. **API-First Design** - Backend functionality exposed through REST APIs
5. **Docs-as-Code** - Documentation lives alongside the code

## Next Steps

- Explore the [Component Details](/architecture/components) for deep-dives into each part
- Review [Data Flows](/architecture/data-flow) to understand how information moves through the system
- Check the [ADRs](/adr) for documented architectural decisions
