## Context

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help preserve institutional knowledge about why architectural decisions were made. We need a consistent format that:
- Captures necessary context for future readers
- Documents alternatives that were considered
- Explains trade-offs and consequences
- Supports a clear lifecycle (proposed → accepted → deprecated/superseded)

## Decision

We will use **MADR (Markdown Any Decision Records) v3.0** format for all ADRs.

The format includes these sections:
1. **Title** - ADR number and descriptive title
2. **Status** - proposed, accepted, deprecated, or superseded
3. **Context** - Problem description and constraints
4. **Decision** - What was decided (active voice)
5. **Consequences** - Positive and negative outcomes
6. **Alternatives Considered** - Other options and why rejected
7. **Related Decisions** - Links to related ADRs

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Widely adopted** - MADR is an industry-standard format
- **Comprehensive** - Captures all relevant decision context
- **Markdown-native** - Works perfectly with MDX documentation
- **Lifecycle support** - Clear status progression
- **Searchable** - Structured format enables consistent search

### Negative

- **Verbose** - More sections than minimal formats
- **Template overhead** - Authors must fill all sections
- **Consistency enforcement** - Requires review to maintain quality

## Alternatives Considered

### Nygard Format

The original, minimal ADR format.

**Rejected because**: Too brief, lacks alternatives section that helps understand decision context.

### Y-statements

Very concise format: "In the context of X, facing Y, we decided Z, to achieve A, accepting B."

**Rejected because**: Too terse for team understanding, lacks structure for complex decisions.

### Custom Format

Design our own ADR format.

**Rejected because**: Reinventing the wheel, MADR already well-designed.
