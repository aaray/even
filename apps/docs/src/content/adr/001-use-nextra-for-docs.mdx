# ADR-001: Use Nextra for Documentation

  <span>Decision Makers: Development Team</span>
</div>

## Context

The EVEN platform needs a documentation site to house:
- Architecture documentation with interactive diagrams
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- User manuals and guides
- API reference documentation

The documentation system must:
- Integrate with our existing Next.js/Bun monorepo
- Support MDX for rich content with React components
- Provide built-in search functionality
- Be easy to maintain alongside code (docs-as-code)
- Match our dark theme and brand

## Decision

We will use **Nextra 4.x** as our documentation framework.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Native Next.js integration** - Nextra is built on Next.js, so it fits perfectly in our monorepo
- **MDX support** - Can embed React components (diagrams, interactive examples) directly in docs
- **Built-in search** - FlexSearch provides fast, client-side full-text search out of the box
- **Minimal configuration** - Works with App Router and has sensible defaults
- **Active community** - Well-maintained with good documentation

### Negative

- **Learning curve** - Team needs to learn Nextra-specific conventions
- **Theme constraints** - Some customization requires understanding Nextra internals
- **Version coupling** - Updates may require testing with our Next.js version

## Alternatives Considered

### Docusaurus

Popular documentation framework with many features.

**Rejected because**: Uses React 17 and Webpack, not compatible with our Next.js 15 + Bun monorepo without significant configuration.

### VitePress

Fast, Vue-based documentation generator.

**Rejected because**: Vue-based, cannot share React components with rest of monorepo.

### Mintlify

Beautiful hosted documentation service.

**Rejected because**: External dependency, ongoing cost, less control over customization.

### Raw MDX + Next.js

Building custom documentation using Next.js MDX support.

**Rejected because**: Would require reimplementing navigation, search, TOC, and other features that Nextra provides out of the box.
