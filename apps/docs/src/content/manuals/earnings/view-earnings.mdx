## Key Metrics Explained

### Total Earnings

The sum of all revenue from product sales, minus:
- Platform fees
- Payment processing fees
- Refunds

### Average Order Value

Calculated as: Total Revenue / Number of Orders

A higher AOV indicates fans are purchasing more per transaction.

### Growth Rate

The percentage change compared to the previous period:
- **Positive (green)** - Revenue increased
- **Negative (red)** - Revenue decreased
- **Neutral (gray)** - No significant change

## Tips for Analyzing Earnings

### Identify Patterns

Look for:
- **Weekly patterns** - Are certain days better for sales?
- **Release impact** - How do new releases affect earnings?
- **Seasonal trends** - Any holidays or events that boost sales?

### Compare Categories

Notice which category performs best:
- If Music dominates, consider expanding your catalog
- If Merch is growing, explore new merchandise options
- If Experiences are strong, plan more events

### Track Growth

Use the 90-day view to spot long-term trends:
- Consistent growth indicates healthy momentum
- Sudden drops may need investigation
- Spikes often correlate with releases or promotions
