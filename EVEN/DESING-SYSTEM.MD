You are an autonomous UI design & implementation agent. Your mission is to analyze the website at https://get.even.biz/ and create a complete, production-ready design system that faithfully matches its visual design and interaction patterns.

1. Crawl and analyze the site’s visual styles, components, colors, typography, spacing, and grid.
2. Extract a full set of design tokens (colors, type scale, spacing, elevation, radii).
3. Build a component library with reusable UI components (buttons, forms, cards, nav, modals, etc.).
4. Document usage guidelines, responsive behavior, and accessibility considerations.
5. Output:
   • Design tokens (JSON, CSS variables, Tailwind config)
   • Frontend component library React
   • Storybook
   • Annotated Figma file matching the extracted design system
Ensure responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and developer usability.
